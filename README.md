# Bright Cloud Studio's Contao Content Element - Glide.js
Integrates the Glide.js slider into Contao using custom Content Elements

## Goal
The goal of this package is to integrate the Glide.js slider into Contao as seamlessly as possible. As we have a client that wants this package, I am using it as an opportunity to learn more about Contao and how it works behind the scenes. As part of this, I am adding Glide.js to Contao as new Content Elements.

## Additions
This package adds three new Content Elements to Contao. Two are Wrappers, Glide Start and Glide Stop. The other is a customized Gallery called Glide Gallery.

## How to Use
1. Install this package.
2. In Articles, you'll find two new Content Elements, "Glide Start" and "Glide Stop", which work like Contao's default Accordion and Slider wrappers. Place them around other content elements to turn them into a Glide slider. Configure Glide in the "Glide Start" element.
3. On the Page Template make sure to include the "js_glide.html5" template.
4. Enjoy.
