# Bright Cloud Studio's Contao Content Element - Glide.js
Integrates the Glide.js slider into Contao using custom Content Elements


## Goal
The goal of this package is to integrate the Glide.js slider into Contao as seamlessly as possible. As we have a client that wants this package, I am using it as an opportunity to learn more about Contao and how it works behind the scenes. As part of this, I am adding Glide.js to Contao as new Content Elements.

## How to Use
Currently, when adding content onto a page within the Articles section of the backend you will find two new Content Elements listed as "Glide Start" and "Glide Stop". These act like Contao's default "Content Wrapper" Content Elements. Just like the Conent Wrappers, you'll need to add the "js_glide.html5" script to that page's Page Template for it to work.

## What's needed before I can use this?
I have everything integrated within Contao, just need to set up the HTML templates. Hopefully by the end of the day here, November 1, 2023, this will be fully usable.
